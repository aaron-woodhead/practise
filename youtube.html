    <!--<img> is a void element and does not need a closing tag. it takes one element called src
    which means source, and serves as the link attribute
    thumbnails/ tells the comuputer that we are looking for a file in the folder called thumbnails-->

    <!--the input element is also a void element. We can set many attributes to this, such as the type.
    In this, we could enter things such as text to get a textbox, or checkbox to get a checkbox. 
    Placeholder lets us enter words into the textbox that will dissapear when we start to type.-->

    <!--A paragraph is a block element. A block element is an element which takes up the entire line.
    Regardless of margin, block elements always take up the line. An input is not a block element, and
    so it will not take up the entire line. This is called an inline-block element. Another example is 
    an image element. These two will be displayed side-by-side. An inline element only appears within 
    a line. Using the display property, we can change the type of element that it is.-->
