    <input class="search-bar" type="text" placeholder="Search" />

    <!--the input element is also a void element. We can set many attributes to this, such as the type.
    In this, we could enter things such as text to get a textbox, or checkbox to get a checkbox. 
    Placeholder lets us enter words into the textbox that will dissapear when we start to type.-->
