    <!--Press tab to indent-->

    <!--Extra spaces are ignored in HMTL, and new lines (when enter is pressed) are also ignored as they are classed as 
extra lines-->

    <!-- <button> is an example of an element, it is followed by </button> to close it-->

    <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/" target="-blank">
      link to chrome
    </a>

    <!-- indentation is typically used to help organise code-->

    <!-- <a> is an anchor element, it is used to create hyperlinks. The link is closed with </a>. The text between the
 opening and closing tags is the text that will be displayed as a link.-->

    <!-- href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/" is a html attribbute, which modifies how an element behaves. 
 Sytnax for an attribute requires a space between it and the element. 'href=' is called an attribute name, and it 
 tells us we are modifying the destination of this link, the link inbetween quotations is called the attribute value.
 'target' is another attribute that deterrmins whether the link is opened in the current page or in a new page. by 
 default it opens in the current page. '_blank' opens the link on a new blank page. 'href' and 'target' only work with 
 the link element.-->

    <br />

    <!-- <br> is a line break, it is a self closing tag. It is used to create a new line in the text. It does not require
 a closing tag. It is used to create space between elements. It is not required, but it is useful for formatting.-->

    <!-- <button class="subscribe-button"> is a button element with a class attribute. The class attribute is used to
